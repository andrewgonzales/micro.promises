 * Using Promise.all, write a function, combineFirstLineOfManyFiles, that:
 *    1. Reads each file at the path in the `filePaths` array
 *    2. Plucks the first line of each file
 *    3. Joins each first line into a new file
 *      - The lines should be in the same order with respect to the input array
 *      - i.e. the second line in the new file should be the first line of `filePaths[1]`
 *    4. Writes the new file to the file located at `writePath`
 *
 * Make sure combineFirstLineOfManyFiles returns a promise so the following will work:
 *
 * combineFirstLineOfManyFiles(someFiles, someWritePath)
 *   .then(function() {
 *     // Any work done here is guaranteed to occur **after**
 *     // the new file has been successfully written
 *   })
